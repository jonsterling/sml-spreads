This is a library that contains a number of Brouwerian data structures.

### Choice Sequences

A choice sequence is an infinite stream of values.

### Spreads

A spread is a tree, which may be infinitely wide and infinitely deep. It may be
thought of as being given by a predicate on finite prefixes of choice sequences
(i.e. a spread law).

### Fans

A fan is a finitarily-branching spread. Fans may be infinitely deep (i.e.
non-well-founded).
